# example-permit

This example shows how a mint can be gated by a ED25519 signature.

## How to setup

1. Deploy minter
2. Deploy example_permit
3. Call `init` with the deployer in explorer
4. `npm i`
5. Update the PRIVATE_KEY, CONTRACT_ADDR, and MINT_TO_ADDR in index.js
6. `node index.js`. Copy the proof
7. Call `mint_with_permit` with any account in the explorer
  a. NOTE: Look at the `MintPermit` signed in `index.js` to get all the params

## How it works

1. Admin generates a public/private key pair (pk, sk)
2. Admin publishes the pk to the smart contract
3. User wants to mint (name, description, uri, recipient). He/she sends the request to the admin who signs it with his sk. The result is a signature.
4. User uses the signature to mint to the smart contract. The smart contract knows what the pk is, so smart contract uses ED25519 to verify that the signature was indeed generated by the sk, using only the pk.
5. If the smart contract verifies the signature successfully, a mint proceeds
